# iDNTI (Individual Daily Note Taking Interface)
Developed using Python TKinter

Many use Microsoft OneNote for taking notes, collecting Action Requests (ARs) or Action Items (AIs). However with iDNTI you can take notes on the fly. No more creating a billion tabs in OneNote and trying to search for old meeting notes.

iDNTI has a single note taking section that allows the user to search via date, meeting title, calendar, work week, etc. on the other hand keeping track on your running list of ARs or AIs for each Quarter. This will make it easy for performance review to look back at the history of work you have done.
